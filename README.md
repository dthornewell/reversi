# Reversi
A version of reversi/othello programed in C++. It uses a minimax algorithm to make intelligent decisions.
This alorithm uses a heuristic map, the mobility and stability of each piece, and the game score to figure out the best move.
It also now uses a Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) to further improve the heuristic capabilities of this program.
